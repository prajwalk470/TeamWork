<h2>Hi this is prajwal, we want to solve the biggest problem of our new generation and also has to bulid many apps to solve the current problem . 
    Publishers need to know what apps to build, how to monetize them, and where to price them. Advertisers and brands need to identify their target users, and determine where to allocate resources in order to reach them most effectively. Investors need to know which apps and genres are growing the quickest, and where users are really spending their time (and money).So join my github repo and help to create new web applicaions and also learn new things .
